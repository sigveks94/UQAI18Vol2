	 * THOUGTHS OF WHAT TO DO
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 1.	Generate neigbour-states to current state
	 * 2.	Generate reward to a given state (both deterministic and non-deterministic)
	 * 3.	Transition-function (both deterministic and non-deterministic)
	 * 4.	Create a utility function that multiplies transition and reward
	 * 5.	Policy iteration
	 * 6.	Find optimal actions according to policy iteration
	 * 7.	Return string of resulting optimal actions
	 * 8.	ant-jar build file
